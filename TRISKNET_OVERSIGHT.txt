TRISKNET_OVERSIGHT:

Alright... the chat function works now, with a few bugs. no matter the user, the profile picture is always displayed as "UN", no matter the user, in the chat.
here are some other things that are missing, or are broken:
When clicking on a different channel, the chat stays the same. The channel doesnt switch, it also says "Chat" above the chat widget, so not only is it hard to differentiate if you are on one channel or the other. Im not sure if switching channel works, while clicking on a different channel works fine, it doesnt change anything on the main page. If I am on general chat, and click on analysis, the messages from general are still in the chatbox.	--- IN FIXING ---



2. When sending a chat, logging out, registering with a new user, and joining the chatroom, the previous chats are not loaded.
3. Remove the Trading Widget from the chatrooms and create a whole new trading page with a button to it on the left bar
4. When in a Chatroom, above where it says "Text Channels", the name of the Chatroom isn't displayed.
5. On the userlist on the right, also display the users Level and Rep(utation)
